## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What happens if I forget my password?**
A: **Your data cannot be recovered.** We use true end-to-end encryption. The password is the only key to decrypt your data. We do not store your password, so if it is lost, the data is permanently inaccessible. Please remember your password and back up your encryption key.

**Q: Where are my encrypted files stored?**
A: All files are securely stored within your single `.eda` vault file. You can place this file on your local drive, an external drive, or a cloud service (like iCloud Drive or Dropbox). Even if your cloud provider is compromised, the contents of your vault remain private.

**Q: How do I restore my vault on a new Mac?**
A: 1. Install EDA SecureVault on your new Mac.
    2. Copy your `.eda` vault file to the new computer.
    3. Use the "Restore from Key" feature, import your backup key file, and enter your password to mount the vault.

**Q: Is this a subscription service?**
A: **No!** We dislike tedious subscriptions. EDA SecureVault is a **one-time purchase**. You pay once and own it for life.
